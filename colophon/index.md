#### Colophon

This website has been written in Vim on a small Thinkpad running the nimble [Crunchbang Linux](http://crunchbang.org/).

It's pure HTML and CSS, plus Markdown for the content. Everything goes through [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for the build and gets pushed straight over at [Github](https://github.com/).

Basic styling provided by [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/).  The typeface is Georgia on a [Cosmic Latte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte) background.
