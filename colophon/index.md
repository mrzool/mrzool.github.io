# {{page.title}}

This website was written on a tough 11&Prime; Thinkpad laptop running [Crunchbang](http://crunchbang.org/), a nimble Linux distro. All the coding was performed in [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), the best text editor on Earth.

The layout is built with standards-compliant HTML5 and CSS. All the content is written in Markdown, while [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and a couple of custom [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) tasks take care of the build process. The resulting code is hosted over at [Github](https://github.com/).

Basic styling is provided by [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) and by some utilities borrowed from [Basscss](http://www.basscss.com/).  The body text is displayed in Georgia --- a classic, reliable and pretty much ubiquitous typeface. Headlines are typeset in all caps, manually-kerned Futura. The morbid white you see filling the background is known as [Cosmic Latte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte).
