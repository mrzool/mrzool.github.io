This website was written on a tiny Thinkpad x100e running [Crunchbang](http://crunchbang.org/ "Crunchbang Linux homepage"), a nimble Linux distro. The coding was performed in [Vim](http://www.vim.org/ "Vim homepage"), the best text editor on Earth.

The layout is built using standards-compliant HTML5 and CSS. All content is written in Markdown, while [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll homepage") and a couple of custom [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/ "Gulp homepage") tasks take care of the build process. The resulting code is hosted over at [Github](https://github.com/mrzool/mrzool.github.io "See the source on Github").

Basic styling is provided by [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/ "Skeleton homepage") and by a couple of single-purpose utilities borrowed from [Basscss](http://www.basscss.com/ "Basscss homepage"). The body text font is Georgia, titles are typeset in Futura. The morbid white you see filling the background is known as [Cosmic Latte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte "Read about Cosmic Latte on Wikipedia").
