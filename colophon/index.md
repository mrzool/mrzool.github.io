#### Colophon

This website was written in Vim on a tough 11&Prime; Thinkpad laptop running [Crunchbang](http://crunchbang.org/), a nimble Linux distro.

The layout is pure HTML &amp; CSS. The content is written in Markdown. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and some custom [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) task take care of the build process. The resulting code is hosted over at [Github](https://github.com/).

Basic styling provided by [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), plus some utility borrowed from [Basscss](http://www.basscss.com/).  The body text type is the ubiquitous Georgia, while headlines are typeset in all caps, manually kerned Futura. The morbid white that fills the background is known as [Cosmic Latte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte).
