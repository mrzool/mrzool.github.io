#### Colophon

This website has been written in Vim on a 11&Prime; Thinkpad running [Crunchbang](http://crunchbang.org/), a nimble Linux distro.

It's pure HTML &amp; CSS, plus Markdown for the content. Everything goes through [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for the build and gets pushed straight over at [Github](https://github.com/).

The basic styling is provided by [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/).  The typeface is Georgia, the background color is known as [Cosmic Latte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte).
