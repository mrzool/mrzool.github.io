# Hello from Berlin.

You've reached the website of Mattia Tezzele, a web developer with background in sociology and economics.

I make things with code. Websites, data visualizations, and other cool stuff. My interests lie somewhere in between design, typography, statistic, music, and human language.

I try to keep it simple.

You can view my open source projects on [Github](http://github.com/mrzool), follow my sparsely updated [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mrzool_) feed, read interesting bits I collect on [Tumblr](http://zoolnotes.tumblr.com), see my photos on [VSCO Grid](https://mrzool.vsco.co/), and track my readings on [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/mrzool) and [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/p/__zool).

I'm currently freelancing in Berlin and I'm available for hire. Send me an [email](mailto:info@mrzool.cc) if you want to say hi. ([PGP key](https://keybase.io/zool))

Thanks for stopping by!
