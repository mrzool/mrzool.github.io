# Hello from Berlin.

You've reached the website of Mattia Tezzele, web developer with background in sociology and economics.

I make things with code. My interests cross over many things, mostly in the areas of frontend development, typography, data visualization, information architecture, responsive design, and human language. Besides that, I like Unix, Vim, Git, Bash, CSS, and open source software.

I've recently started writing on technical subjects. Here are links to a couple of my articles:
