# Hello from Berlin.

You've reached the website of Mattia Tezzele, web developer with background in sociology and economics.

My interests cross over into many things, mostly in the areas of frontend development, responsive design, typography, data visualization, information architecture, and human language. Besides that, I like Unix, Vim, Git, web standards, and open source software.

### Writing

Just a couple of articles for the time being:

### Elsewhere

You can view my code on [Github](http://github.com/mrzool), follow my sparsely updated [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mrzool_) feed, verify my identity on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/zool), read interesting bits I collect on [Tumblr](http://zoolnotes.tumblr.com), see my photos on [VSCO Grid](https://mrzool.vsco.co/), and track my readings on [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/mrzool) and [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/p/__zool).

I'm currently freelancing in Berlin and I'm available for projects. Send me an [email](mailto:info@mrzool.cc) if you want to say hi. [[PGP](https://keybase.io/zool/key.asc)]

Thanks for stopping by!
