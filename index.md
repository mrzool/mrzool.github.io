I'm Mattia---developer and audiophile based in Berlin.

My interests include---in no particular order---design, typography, language, social sciences, and the web. I also have a thing for textual interfaces and enjoy fiddling with Unix, Vim, and other fine software.

### Projects

You can view the full list of my open-source projects on my [GitHub profile](http://github.com/mrzool).

### Writing

I occasionally publish long-form technical articles on this website:

{% include _posts.html %}

I also maintain a more frequently updated [microblog](http://notes.mrzool.cc) where I collect interesting bits about technology, programming, linguistics, music, and pretty much everything that catches my interest.

### Elsewhere

You can follow my sparsely updated [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mrzool_) feed, verify my identity at [Keybase](https://keybase.io/zool), see my photos on [VSCO Grid](https://mrzool.vsco.co/), and track my readings on [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/mrzool) and [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/p/__zool).
