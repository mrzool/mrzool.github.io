# Hello from Berlin.

You've reached the small website of Mattia Tezzele, developer with background in social sciences and a fascination for design, language, textual interfaces and information architecture.

### Projects

You can view the full list of my open-source projects on my [GitHub profile](http://github.com/mrzool).

### Writing

I occasionally publish long-form technical articles on this website:

{% include _posts.html %}

Subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed.xml) to be notified of new posts.

I also maintain a more frequently updated [microblog](http://notes.mrzool.cc) where I collect the interesting bits I come across in my readings---mostly on programming, linguistics, design and music.

### Elsewhere

You can view my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/mrzool), follow my sparsely updated [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mrzool_) feed, verify my identity at [Keybase](https://keybase.io/zool), see my photos on [VSCO Grid](https://mrzool.vsco.co/), and track my readings on [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/mrzool) and [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/p/__zool).

To get in touch with me, send me an email at [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}) [[PGP](https://keybase.io/zool/key.asc)]
