At this stage in my career, I'm making a living by architecting and building clean, performant, readable, and no-nonsense websites. As a consequence, I often find myself doing consultancy in the fields of marketing, brand identity and product design. Eventually I'd like to move on to the other, more research-y areas of data science and data journalism.

I'm currently freelancing in Berlin and I'm [available for hire](/contact).

I speak Italian, English and German.

Some of the things I work with:

- Mobile-first and responsive web design
- HTML, CSS/Sass, JavaScript, basic PHP & Python, LaTeX
- tmux, Vim, Git, Bash, Node, NPM, Jekyll/Liquid, pandoc
- All-around Unix-fu.
- Not a master, but pretty familiar with Sketch, Photoshop and InDesign.
